    Steps (when fully implemented):
      1. **Voice Embedding Extraction:** Load your voice sample and extract an embedding.
      2. **Spectrogram Synthesis:** Use the text and embedding to generate a mel spectrogram.
      3. **Waveform Generation:** Convert the spectrogram into an audio waveform.
      4. **Save Audio:** Write the waveform as a WAV file.
    
    For demonstration, this function simply copies the sample voice file to the output.
